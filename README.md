Redux Weather App

Uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch 5 Day forecast weather data for US cities that user searches. The app also sends the OpenWeatherMap API coordinate data to the GoogleMaps API to display a map of the city that is searched.

The app has been deployed to heroku at the following url: https://floating-hollows-71420.herokuapp.com/
